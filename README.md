# cryptoc

Some fiddling around with crypto currency tech. Implementing little toy projects

### ScroogeCoin

A centralised cryptocurrency, or at least the skeleton thereof. Probably buggy and definitely not very elegantly implemented :p.

### DistCoin

A decentralised cryptocurrency. No mining incentives implemented yet, no adjustment for proof of work difficulty.
